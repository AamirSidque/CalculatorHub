<h2>Basic Calculator – Accurate Arithmetic for Everyday Calculations</h2>

<p>
The Basic Calculator is one of the most widely used digital tools in the world.
Despite its simplicity, it plays a critical role in education, finance, commerce,
and daily decision-making. This calculator is designed to replicate the behavior
of a physical handheld calculator while adding the benefits of speed, clarity,
and accessibility.
</p>

<p>
Unlike complex mathematical tools, a basic calculator focuses on core arithmetic
operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations
form the foundation of all higher-level mathematics and are used countless times
each day by people across industries.
</p>

<h3>How the Basic Calculator Works</h3>

<p>
Each input entered into the calculator is processed sequentially, just like a
traditional calculator. This ensures predictable behavior and avoids unexpected
results that can occur in poorly implemented tools.
</p>

<p>
The calculator processes numerical input, applies arithmetic operators, and
returns results instantly. Errors such as invalid expressions are safely handled
to maintain accuracy and trust.
</p>

<h3>Common Use Cases</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Adding totals while shopping or budgeting</li>
  <li>Calculating expenses and profits</li>
  <li>Learning arithmetic fundamentals</li>
  <li>Office and administrative work</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters</h3>

<p>
Even small calculation errors can lead to incorrect financial decisions or academic
mistakes. This calculator uses standard arithmetic logic and avoids unsafe evaluation
methods, ensuring consistent and reliable results.
</p>
