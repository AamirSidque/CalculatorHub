<h2>Loan EMI Calculator – Plan Your Finances with Confidence</h2>

<p>
A loan EMI calculator is a critical financial planning tool used by individuals
and businesses to understand repayment obligations before taking a loan.
EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment, which is the fixed payment made
each month toward a loan.
</p>

<p>
This calculator helps users determine their monthly EMI, total interest payable,
and the complete amortization schedule. It is suitable for home loans, personal
loans, car loans, and business loans.
</p>

<h3>What Is EMI?</h3>

<p>
EMI is calculated based on three factors: loan amount, interest rate, and loan tenure.
Each EMI includes both principal repayment and interest payment.
</p>

<h3>EMI Formula</h3>

<p>
<strong>
EMI = P × r × (1 + r)<sup>n</sup> / ((1 + r)<sup>n</sup> − 1)
</strong>
</p>

<h3>Understanding Amortization</h3>

<p>
An amortization schedule shows how each EMI payment is split between interest
and principal. In the early stages of the loan, a larger portion goes toward
interest. Over time, principal repayment increases.
</p>
